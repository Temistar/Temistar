 ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are my personal project relating to my PhD Research in Quantum and ML Journey

I have also accumulated helpful Quantum, ML and Data Science resources for beginners to intermediate levels based on my past projects and teachings. Some of the Books, Codes, projects and curriculum are for my students at Cleveland State University, Africa Quantum Consortium, STEM Zone and Hash.Code.Design.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing optimal quantum sensor circuits for biomedical applications and analyzing their performance using large-scale quantum simulation and data-driven optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about probabilistic programming and scalable data modeling for uncertainty-aware AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on quantum computing, machine learning, and big dataâ€“driven research projects that explore the intersection of AI automation and quantum intelligence. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about STEM learning path for kids!
- âš¡ Fun fact: ðŸ˜„ I started ML with Java before learning python!
